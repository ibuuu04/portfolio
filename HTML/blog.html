        The Evolution of Web Development
        Web development has come a long way since the early days of static HTML pages. Today, we have a plethora of tools and technologies at our disposal, from powerful JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js to robust backend solutions like Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails. The evolution of web development is driven by the need for more dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
        
        One of the most significant changes has been the shift towards mobile-first design. With more users accessing websites via smartphones and tablets, creating a seamless mobile experience is no longer optional—it's essential. Responsive design principles and frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have become indispensable in this regard.</p>
